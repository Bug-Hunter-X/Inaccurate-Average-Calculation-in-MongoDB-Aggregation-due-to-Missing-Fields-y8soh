```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" },
      totalUsers: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
])
```
This aggregation pipeline has a potential bug: it attempts to calculate the average age using a field named `age`, however if some users in your collection don't have an `age` field, the `$avg` operator will either skip them or throw an error (depending on MongoDB version and settings). This could lead to incorrect average age calculations.
